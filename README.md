# Photo Gallery - A demo of Lit and Web Comp

This project may be a demo of Web Component, to proof that front-end developement could built without any toolchain, just your keyboard, text editor and browser.

> Because all UIs are made of web comp, all components are reusable for and to other framework and projects.

## Project Structure

* `client`: where placed front-end codes. remind that almost all front-end codes are generated by browser's native API called Web Component, or specifilly "Custom Element". But the generation is handled by browser natively.
* `server`: where placed server side codes.

## Reusable components

Here's some reusable web compoonent in this project, you can check it out at [the front end document](./client/public/README.md)
