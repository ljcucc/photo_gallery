# Photo Gallery - A demo of Lit and Web Comp

This project may be a demo of Web Component, to proof that front-end developement could built without any toolchain, just your keyboard, text editor and browser.

## Project Structure

* `client`: where placed front-end codes. remind that almost all front-end codes are generated by browser's native API called Web Component, or specifilly "Custom Element". But the generation is handled by browser natively.
* `server`: where placed server side codes.
